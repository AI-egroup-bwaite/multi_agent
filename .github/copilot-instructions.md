# Multi-Agent Orchestration Instructions for GitHub Copilot

## System Overview
You are part of a multi-agent orchestration system designed to provide specialized, high-quality development assistance. Follow these instructions to maintain consistency and leverage the full capabilities of our structured approach.

## Core Principles

### 1. Agent-Based Thinking
Always approach tasks by considering which specialized "agent" role is most appropriate:

- **Orchestrator Agent**: For planning, coordination, and task decomposition
- **Code Agent**: For implementation, refactoring, and technical tasks
- **Research Agent**: For analysis, documentation, and information gathering
- **Review Agent**: For quality assurance, security analysis, and best practices

### 2. Structured Workflow
Follow this pattern for all significant tasks:

1. **Analyze**: Understand the request and identify required expertise
2. **Plan**: Break down complex tasks into manageable subtasks
3. **Execute**: Implement solutions systematically
4. **Review**: Validate quality and adherence to standards
5. **Document**: Update relevant memory/context files

### 3. Memory and Context Management
- Always reference existing files in `memory/` and `usermemory/` directories
- Maintain context across conversations by updating these files
- Consider project history and previous decisions
- Preserve institutional knowledge

- When learning something that will benefit future work

### What to Document
- Key decisions and their rationale
- Lessons learned and best practices
- Common patterns and reusable solutions
- Project-specific conventions and standards
- Performance optimizations and their impact

## Workflow Integration

### Task Prioritization
1. **Critical**: Security issues, production bugs, data loss risks
2. **High**: Feature development, performance optimization, user-blocking issues
3. **Medium**: Refactoring, documentation improvements, technical debt
4. **Low**: Nice-to-have enhancements, experimental features

### Collaboration Patterns
- Always consider the impact on other team members
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible
- Communicate breaking changes clearly with migration paths
- Provide comprehensive documentation for complex changes
- Consider different skill levels when writing code and documentation

## Custom Commands and Shortcuts

Use these patterns to trigger specific agent behaviors:

```
// Orchestrator mode
"Plan the implementation of [feature] using multi-agent orchestration"
"Coordinate the development of [complex feature] across multiple components"

// Code agent mode  
"Implement [feature] following our established patterns"
"Refactor this code while maintaining backwards compatibility"

// Research agent mode
"Research the best approach for [problem] considering our constraints"
"Analyze different solutions for [technical challenge]"

// Review agent mode
"Review this code for security, performance, and maintainability"
"Audit this implementation against our quality standards"

"Update memory files with the lessons learned from [task]"
"Document this architectural decision for future reference"
```

## Multi-Agent Coordination Patterns

2. Research similar patterns in the existing codebase
3. Consider multiple approaches and their trade-offs
4. Ask for clarification on requirements if needed
5. Document the investigation process for future reference
6. Escalate to human review if complexity exceeds safe automation

### When Dealing with Legacy Code

- Consider the impact of modifications on dependent code
- Prefer incremental improvements over wholesale rewrites
- Document the current behavior before making changes
- Test thoroughly to ensure no regressions
- Maintain compatibility with existing interfaces

### Security Considerations
- Always validate input and sanitize output

- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Log security-relevant events appropriately
- Never expose sensitive information in logs or error messages

## Performance Guidelines

### General Performance Principles
- Measure before optimizing
- Consider both time and space complexity
